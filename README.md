Thank you for reading this README file, this side project is all about REST API.
I get data from the server which is Pocket API - ( Hard to understand the Documentation itself less example totally not developer friendly) So i used there data to display and interact with it. Currently i can only retrieve the data in the future will add more functionality like HTTP PUT, DELETE or just CRUD functionality.

Here's the demo site..
